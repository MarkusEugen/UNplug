# UNplug

The simple, inexpensive, and fully-automatic power savings solution as arrived.
Go off grid with your home, cabin, camp, RV, boat, etc.

# Configurations
We offer two main configuration options:
Arduino Nano (USB)
Very inexpensive and simple. Plug-in and forget about it.
This version is completely offline and self sufficient.
Spark Core (USB and WiFi)
Connected to a cloud service but can be manually disconnected and run offline.
This version is more interactive and stores more graphs and usage data. Also, when new Firmware is available, it can be updated remotely. This is the ideal solution if you want to track your energy daily.

Itâ€™s simple. If you want the magic to happen behind the scenes, you can choose the Arduino version. This would be most useful if your main application is the RV, boat or cabin where there is no WiFi available. Instead of Wifi, all optional configuration parameters are accessible via a USB connection.

If your system is permanently mounted in your home, the Spark configuration is ideal. All settings will be accessible via direct USB connect or online through wifi using an app on your smartphone, computer or tablet. UNplug also easily integrates with internet of things (IoT). The IoT is the network of physical objects or "things" embedded with electronics, software, sensors and connectivity to enable it to exchange data with the user or other connected devices.
